    <Profile orientation="horizontal" />
  
    <p>I’m a software engineer with a passion for building innovative solutions.</p>
    <p>With over 15 years of experience in software development, I’ve contributed to a wide range of projects, spanning from agile startups to large-scale enterprise applications.  </p>
    <p>My enthusiasm for technology stems from its ability to solve real-world challenges. This passion has driven my entrepreneurial journey, starting with founding my first company, <b>Aibol</b> (2014), followed by launching my own consulting firm (2015). From 2016 to 2018, I collaborated with a startup builder company, helping launch <b>Docker</b>, <b>Vestgo</b>, <b>Obba</b>, <b>Vinixo</b>, and <b>Sova360</b>. In 2018, I joined the founding team of <b>Dr.Entrega</b> and later became a partner at <b>Revelo</b> in 2020.</p>
    <p>I thrive on generating and executing new ideas, thinking through every aspect from conception to execution: the business model, the technology, the team, the market, and the clients.</p>
    <p>Currently, I’m captivated by the potential of generative AI and its transformative impact on the future, often imagining innovations yet to come.</p>
    <p>This space is a platform for me to share my thoughts, projects, achievements, and anything else I find inspiring.</p>
